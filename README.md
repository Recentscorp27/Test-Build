# Test-Build

This repository contains a simple script to generate short poems based on feelings and emotions.

## Usage

Run the script with a comma-separated list of emotions:

```bash
python3 poetry_app.py happy,sad,love
```

The script will output a short poem containing lines related to the provided emotions. Feel free to extend the `EMOTION_LINES` dictionary in `poetry_app.py` with more emotions and lines.
